# ModularRocketSystems-ScrapyardBob
This adds new parts for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) using NecroBones' ModularRocketSystems (MRS) via ModuleManager (MM) configuration files.

In general, this means creating heavier and costlier versions of command pods, control units, or other parts which have more fuel / battery / range in order to reduce part count.  If you're going to attach a battery (or five) and then no-clip the result to be hidden, it's possibly better to use a MM configuration to do it.
