# ScrapyardBob's Modified Parts for KSP 1.5.1

This adds new parts for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) via ModuleManager (MM) configuration files.  

In general, this means creating heavier and costlier versions of command pods, control units, or other parts which have more fuel / battery / range in order to reduce part count.  If you're going to attach a battery (or five) and then no-clip the result to be hidden, I believe that it's better to use a MM configuration to do it.  The result is a more stable KSP with ships that have lower part counts.

### Installation

Because this is all done with ModuleManager configuration files, you can simply clone the git repository down to your KSP `GameData/` folder and checkout the appropriate branch.  Or download the entire repository as a ZIP file and just put it somewhere under your `GameData/` folder.

### Pull Requests

I prefer to use the git "[forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)" for change requests.
