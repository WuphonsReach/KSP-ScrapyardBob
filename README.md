# ModRocketSys-ScrapyardBob
This adds new parts for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) using NecroBones' ModularRocketSystems (MRS) via ModuleManager (MM) configuration files.

In general, this means creating heavier and costlier versions of command pods, control units, or other parts which have more fuel / battery / range in order to reduce part count.  If you're going to attach a battery (or five) and then no-clip the result to be hidden, I believe that it's better to use a MM configuration to do it.

## Installation

Because this is all done with ModuleManager configuration files, you can simply clone the git repository down to your KSP `GameData/` folder and checkout the appropriate branch.

## Submissions

I prefer to use the git "[forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)" for change reqeusts.

## Parts

All Command Modules
- Automatically get a MechJeb AR202 capability

MRS Guidance Nose-Cone
